      <p>Yari D'areglia's project BWWalkthrough is implemented in Swift and is a very cool example of a walkthrough tutorial. I wanted to duplicate what he had done in Objective-C without using storyboards. I implemented the Objective-C version very closely to the Swift version, although I would eliminate some of the unneeded protocol functions that are not needed.</p>

<p>Credits</p>

<p>Thanks to Yari D'areglia for his most excellent BWWalkthrough project, and also to Aleksandar VaciÄ‡ for his Objective-C port that uses storyboards that inspired me to also release my port.</p>
