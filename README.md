# CSWXIBWalkThrough
An Objective-C clone of github/ariok/BWWalkthrough using only XIB files, no storyboards
Yari D'areglia's project BWWalkthrough is implemented in Swift and is a very cool example of a walkthrough tutorial. I wanted to duplicate what he had done in Objective-C without using storyboards. I implemented the Objective-C version very closely to the Swift version, although I would eliminate some of the unneeded protocol functions that are not needed.

Thanks to Yari D'areglia for his most excellent BWWalkthrough project, and also to Aleksandar VaciÄ‡ for his Objective-C port that uses storyboards that inspired me to also release my port.
